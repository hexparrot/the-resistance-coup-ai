This is the github repository for The Resistance: Coup game simulator.

This project is to model human behavior, bluffing, and strategy of the game The Resistance: Coup by Rikki Tahta.

It is currently developed and working on python 2.7 and 3.x, though the 2.x/3.x compatiblity is incidental.  As the project develops, either one may be selected to be the main development environment, depending on future needs such as Neural Network modules, etc.
